Prompt

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

Response
~~~~~~~~

I would respond with message like; I'm sorry to hear that you are not receiving the allocations
you have requested. When oversubscribed, we have a policy of allocating shares based on total 
current holdings of the venture. This is largely based on a preference for startups who typically
prefer to follow on investors, and to give first rights to current shareholders. As your basis increases
so does your opportunity to invest in the future. I would be happy to jump on a call should you have 
an interest to discuss how this pro-ration approach is utilized. Furthermore, this policy 
incentivizes investors to invest in low capitalized companies, giving them first right to
invest based on their total basis. I would be happy to share some deals with you where you
can get a high % of basis. As always; I we at AngelList are happy to help you find the right deal for you.

With this response I am pacifying their concerns, and also providing them with a solution and pushing them 
to an action that allows for more deal flow.Â
