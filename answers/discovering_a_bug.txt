I would run this app using a postgres database and record all of the activity, as per implemented with this working example. I would also make sure to have users log in with a sign in with a check box saying they agree to the terms of service. In this terms of service, there should be specific terms around; "the final allocations when executed are final". Also prior to execution, I would send everyone an email with a confirmation of the amounts they are investing and % of such. At the same time there should be a serious bug; This way we can see exactly what happened and recall back with an investigation and a report, and a resolution. Given that equity is already distributed, it would likely not be an option to change the holdings of the company. But should there have been an accounting error, or reasonable mistake, I would work with the company who raised the money, raise this to their attention. From an organizational perspective, I would put this process/project management:

    1. Open a slack channel called Bug Reporting, that has a staff assigned to it; which rotates weekly. This way we can have a dev on call to address any issues. As issues come in; staff can report the bug, and the staff would just go into the database, look up the transaction, check to see if it was an issue, provide a resolution and post that on the channel. Then that person would be responsible for the resolution. This doesn't have to be a tech staff; more a customer service staff.
    2. I would also have a monthly meeting with the team to discuss any issues that came up, and how we can prevent them in the future.
